## [0.0.2] - 2016-03-24
### Added
- dotfile loading now works, and will create a default dotfile if missing.
Default dotfile is currently stupid and useless, like the rest of nmi!

## [0.0.1] - 2016-03-24
### Added
- Added in help text for usage. nmi doesn't follow those instructions yet, of
course

## [0.0.0] - 2016-03-24
### Added
- Added scaffolding of nmi components, will only print information about how
it was invoked and exit
