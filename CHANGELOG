## [0.0.5] - 2016-03-25
### Added
- Added some more arguments that should be supported, and a warning on one
that won't be supported immediately

### Added
- Put an error message into nmi if you didn't tell it to install anything
- Added more git helpers and made the method names less redundant
- The cache object now does something useful!

## [0.0.3] - 2016-03-25
### Added
- dotfile loading now builds a more useful default .nmirc file, also creates
the .nmi and .nmi/cache directories

- git_helpers now has two helpers! Not tested, yet.

## [0.0.2] - 2016-03-24

Default dotfile is currently stupid and useless, like the rest of nmi!

course

## [0.0.0] - 2016-03-24

it was invoked and exit
