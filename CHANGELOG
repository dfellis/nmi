# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [0.0.7] - 2016-04-01
### Added
- ./bin/nmi install -u will now actually copy the nmi code (minus the .git
directory) to ~/.nmi/builds/nmi
- There is now a -f arg to force operations that will otherwise abort (trying
to install -u a node module will fail if it's installed that way already)
- dotfile.js now references a builds directory and adds it into the default
config
### Changed
- README corrected about the existence of actual code
- nmi is now consistently camelCase instead of mixed camelCase and snake_case

## [0.0.6] - 2016-03-28
### Added
- Added new arguments and updated the README about the planned `audit`
subcommand

## [0.0.5] - 2016-03-25
### Added
- Added some more arguments that should be supported, and a warning on one
that won't be supported immediately
- Add in logic to the cache to get a module's package.json at the specified
version
- Began work on the dependency tree generation

## [0.0.4] - 2016-03-25
### Added
- Put an error message into nmi if you didn't tell it to install anything
- Added more git helpers and made the method names less redundant
- The cache object now does something useful!

## [0.0.3] - 2016-03-25
### Added
- dotfile loading now builds a more useful default .nmirc file, also creates
the .nmi and .nmi/cache directories
- cache object slightly more useful
- git_helpers now has two helpers! Not tested, yet.

## [0.0.2] - 2016-03-24
### Added
- dotfile loading now works, and will create a default dotfile if missing.
Default dotfile is currently stupid and useless, like the rest of nmi!

## [0.0.1] - 2016-03-24
### Added
- Added in help text for usage. nmi doesn't follow those instructions yet, of
course

## [0.0.0] - 2016-03-24
### Added
- Added scaffolding of nmi components, will only print information about how
it was invoked and exit
